    <string name="bio">I was born in a penal colony on the Ryukyu Islands (most likely Miyako Island since it was a penal colony in the past),
        which was a separate kingdom with close ties to the Satsuma domain of Japan. \n\nMy name means without limitation, as the components
        of it are the characters for "without" and "limitation." I use the infinity symbol (∞) for my name, which is the Japanese word for "eternity".
        People often say my Japanese is rough and "Yanki". I may be partially illiterate, but I\'m not stupid. You wanna know who my parents are, yeah… me too.
        Yamato bastards put me in the South.
        \n\nFishing is a life and death struggle between man and fish. Forget this and you will most certainly get hurt.
        \n\nDon\'t live your life making up excuses. The one making your choices is yourself!
        \n\nIf you\'re gonna send people after me, bring on the strongest you have.
        \n\nIf we were all the way up there, no one here\'d look any bigger than a grain of sand.
        \n\nIf living means that I must bow down to you guys, I will happily stand tall and die!\n\n</string>
